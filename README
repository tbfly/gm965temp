Installation:
-------------

1. To build this module
   make

2. To install it.
   sudo make install

3. Use patched "sensor-detect.gm965temp"
   It can detect gm965temp support chips.

4. Enjoy gm965temp and help us to improve it.

5. Notes.

Support Chips:
--------------

. Intel 3 Series : G33/Q33 P35/Q35
. Intel 4 Series : G41 B43/G43/Q43 G45/P45/Q45
. Mobile Intel 965 Express : GL/GLE960 PM/GM/GME965
. Mobile Intel 4 Series : PM/GM45

Testing Status:
---------------

PM/GM965  : TR1, RTR1 report reasonable values 50 - 65°C
PM45      : TR1 reports 0°C
remaining : yet untested

Remarks:
--------

On a cold start temperature reporting may be 0 degC due to
hardware not permitting temperature reading below a certain
temperature threshold. After a few minutes chipset temp
should be >= 40 degC and gm965temp module is supposed to
deliver values.

Ocassionally but rarely reported temps may flip to 0 degC.
